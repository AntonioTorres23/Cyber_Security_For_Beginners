Hello and Welcome to Some Additional Documentation on How to Install Packages For This Project:

Some Reminders: 

  - A lot of this project is built upon packages that are not prepackaged with a standard python install. 

  - This may cause a lot of frustration for some users (It certainly caused me some).

Using the Venv:

  - I highly advise NOT TO USE THE VENV TO RUN THIS PROJECT. 

  - After some research, Virtual Environments are great for individuals who want a separate workspace for their python projects on their own computers. 
  
  - However, they have a preset config file that has my paths for my computer. You can try to change it to yours, but it is not guaranteed.
  
The venv was here to show users what I did to create this project and why it is a good idea for you to use one as well. 
  
WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND:
  
  - I recommend using the requirements.txt file to install the packages.
  
  - To do so, use the following command: pip install -r .\requirements.txt
  
  - You want to use this command inside the Cyber_Security_For_Beginners directory. 
  
  - Make sure you have both a version of Python 3.10+ and pip installed on your computer. 
  
  - In the next document Iâ€™ll cover how to troubleshoot issues that may arise.
